If you don't know what Deus Ex Randomizer is, then here's our trailer which shows a breakdown of how it works:

Here's a trailer for WaltonWare mode. WaltonWare mode is focused on quick wins by completing a single bingo line, and increasing difficulty after every win. The bingo goals are all scaled to their minimum settings and you start in a random area. All bingo goals will be completable within just a few maps!
