# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and **shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time** but with the same great story. The goal is to **increase the replayability and strategy**. There is logic in place to ensure **the game is always beatable**. If you're stuck, try to formulate a new strategy, explore more, or go back to an earlier save if you need to.

Our installer also properly configures **compatibility and performance fixes** like DXVK, Kentie's Launcher, D3D10 and other renderers, Engine.dll, config tweaks, and more to allow high frame rates and resolutions on modern computers, all done automatically for you.

We also offer **Vanilla Fixer**: This one is for the purists. Use our installer program and it will do all of **our compatibility fixes for the vanilla game**. Then just run DeusEx.exe as normal and the gameplay will be unchanged but with high frame rates and resolutions!

[Compatible with vanilla Deus Ex, GOTY, Lay D Denton, GMDX, Revision, HX co-op, and Vanilla? Madder.](https://mods4ever.com/)

## Deus Ex Randomizer Game Modes
  - **Normal Randomizer**: Randomizes the costs and strengths of skills, and the strengths of augmentations. Shuffles locations of items/datacubes/nanokeys/crates/enemies. Randomizes passwords. Also randomizes which maps medical bots and repair bots are in, and much more!
    - **Full Randomizer**: The next step after completing Normal Randomizer. Also adds randomized goal locations and start locations, randomized auto turrets, and more randomization in general.
  - **Zero Rando**: Great for first-time Deus Ex players and veterans alike. Benefit from our bug fixes and optional QoL improvements, without any randomization.
    - **Zero Rando Plus**: Same as Zero Rando, but also enables our balance changes.
    - See the Rando ➜ Gameplay menu for more customization of balance changes and QoL features.
  - **WaltonWare**: A quick option to get into the game without the time commitment of the full game. You start in a random mission and **win by completing one bingo line**. All bingo goals will be completable within just a few maps. As New Game+ keeps making it harder, see how fast you can complete them or how many you can complete! Also check out the full game variant of this: Mr. Page's Mean Bingo Machine.
  - Various [**Halloween modes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbzNkWJXZ1o) that add survival horror mechanics, such as zombies, limited saves, and an invincible stalker!
  - See the [(Wiki page)](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Game-Modes) for a full list of our game modes.

## There are also settings for
- **Autosaves** and rotating quicksaves.
- **Crowd Control**: Let your Twitch/YouTube/Discord/other viewers troll you or help you! https://crowdcontrol.live/guides/DeusEx
    - If you want to try some of the Crowd Control features without actually streaming, you can try the "**Offline Simulated**" mode in the New Game screen.
- **New Game+**: after beating the game, play it again keeping most of your items, skills, and augs, but with increased difficulty and a new seed.
- **Challenge mode loadouts**: See the [(Wiki page)](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Loadouts) for a full list.
    - **Stick With the Prod Pure**: the only weapon you can use is the stun prod.
        - **Stick With the Prod Plus**: also allows EMP grenades, gas grenades, scramble grenades, pepper gun, and tranq darts.<br>Much less frustrating and more fun than "Pure".
    - And many more!
- If you opt-in to Online Features (which are disabled by default, check the Rando menu)
  - **Get notifications of new updates!**
  - [Death Markers](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Death-Markers): see where other players have died!
  - Your in-game events will also contribute to [our bot on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DXRandoActivity)
- **Integrated Bingo Board**: On the Goals screen there's a Bingo button in the middle bar.
  - Also an external BingoDisplay program you can download from the Github [Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases/latest). Great for streamers who want to show their bingo progress live to viewers.
- Reducing the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells.
- Starting the game with the Speed Enhancement augmentation.
- Assistance options like autofill for passwords and keypad codes.
- The ability to reveal where Nanokeys/Datacubes/goals are located (using buttons on the Goals screen).
- On the main menu there's also a Rando button for a bunch of global settings, like music controls, online features, an extra brightness boost option, balance change options, and some QoL options.

[See the full list of balance changes here in the wiki so you may be better able to adapt to the unique challenges DXRando generates.](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Balance-Changes)

If you're having trouble with D3D10 on Windows (typically it will revert to software rendering, which limits your resolution and performance, and causes objects to warp and draw on top of each other incorrectly), you probably need to install [vc_redist 17](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) or [vc_redist 10](http://download.microsoft.com/download/C/6/D/C6D0FD4E-9E53-4897-9B91-836EBA2AACD3/vcredist_x86.exe). Otherwise use D3D9 or OpenGL (and check the Rando ➜ Visuals menu for Brightness Boost).
