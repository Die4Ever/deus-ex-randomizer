# deus-ex-randomizer

Copy the `DeusEx.u` file into your `Deus Ex\System\` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System` (make a backup of the original `DeusEx.u`)

Recommended to use it with [Kentie's Deus Exe Launcher](http://www.kentie.net/article/dxguide/), or [Han's Launcher](https://coding.hanfling.de/launch/#binaries). I play with OpenGL renderer because the Direct3D renderers have trouble on newer Nvidia drivers.

Currently in v1.4, DXRando randomizes
* adding and changing characters, giving them random names and making some of them dance
* changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys around the map
* passwords and passcodes (they get updated in your Goals/Notes screen)
* the locations of datacubes
* exp costs for skills
* what augmentations are in each canister

There are also settings for
* new game modes!
    * Horde Mode is in beta and mostly I think it just needs balancing.
    * Rearranged levels is in alpha and is incomplete.
* making all doors that normally require a key also lockpickable/destructible
* making all keypads hackable.
* making enemies respawn
* reducing the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells
* starting the game with the running speed augmentation
* autosave
* removing invisible walls

When you start a new game, you will see this settings screen

For the randomized passwords, you can copy-paste from the Goals/Notes screen.
