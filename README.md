# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story. The goal is to increase the replayability and strategy.

    * Option for rerolling every mission, defaults to reroll every 5 missions
    * Option for disabling the Downgrade button on the new game screen, to prevent looking ahead
* What augmentations are in each canister
* The strength and lockpick strength for doors
* The hack strength for keypads
* The strength of augmentations and skills (make sure to read their descriptions)

## There are also settings for
* Crowd Control! Let your Twitch/YouTube/Discord/other viewers troll you or help you! https://crowdcontrol.live/guides/DeusEx
    * If you want to try some of the Crowd Control features without actually streaming, you can try the "Offline Simulated" mode in the New Game screen!
* New Game+ - after beating the game play it again keeping your items, skills, and augs, but with increased difficulty and a new seed
    * Takes away 1 random augmentation, and 1 of your weapons
    * Takes away half your skill points and 5 random skill levels, so the player has to choose which ones to level up first
* New game modes!
    * Entrance Randomization - changes what level each teleporter takes you to, but keeps it within the same mission.
    * Horde Mode - fight for your life to see how long you can survive in the Paris Cathedral.
    * Zero Rando - great for first-time Deus Ex players to benefit from the bug fixes and QoL improvements we've made, without any randomization.
    * Randomizer Lite - randomizes some things without interfering with the immersion and mood of the game. Great for players who haven't played Deus Ex in a long time, or if you're intimidated by the full Randomizer.
    * Serious Sam mode - same as the normal game but with 10x as many enemies. The player has increased health and takes reduced damage to compensate.
* Challenge mode loadouts!
    * Stick With the Prod Pure means the only weapon you get is the stun prod (hint: throw a crate straight up into the air to break it)
        * Stick With the Prod Plus also allows EMP grenades, gas grenades, scramble grenades, pepper gun, and tranq darts
    * Ninja JC - the only weapons allowed are throwing knives, swords, pepper spray, and grenades. You also get a Ninja Augmentation which gives you speed and stealth at the same time
    * Don't Give Me the GEP Gun - bans the GEP gun
    * Freeman Mode - only weapon allowed is the crowbar
    * Grenades Only
    * No Pistols - for people who think the pistol is OP
    * No Swords - for people who think the sword and Dragon's Tooth Sword are OP
    * No Overpowered Weapons - bans pistols, swords, and the GEP Gun
    * By the Book - bans lockpicks and multitools
* Max Rando - randomize the randomizer's settings!
* An integrated Bingo board: on the Goals screen there's a Bingo button in the middle bar, there's also our external BingoDisplay program you can download from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases)
* Co-op when combined with the HX mod (Alpha)
* Making all or some of the doors that normally require a key also lockpickable and/or destructible
* Making all or some keypads hackable.
* Reducing the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells
* Autosave
* Making enemies respawn
* Starting the game with the running speed augmentation
* Optional hardcore Autosave-Only mode, no save-scumming allowed!
* Option to keep the game running while menus are open, making hacking or inventory management more difficult
* Autofill passwords options
* [Death Markers](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Death-Markers) - see where other players have died!
* If you opt-in to Online Features (which is disabled by default), then your in-game events will also contribute to [our bot on Mastodon (which is an open source and community-run version of Twitter)](https://botsin.space/@DXRandoActivity)

## Balance Chances

DXRando features many small but impactful balance changes that can expand your tactical options.

The large metal crates are now destructible with 2000hp. Alcohol now fixes dead legs. Things that normally aren't useful have been buffed, such as hazmat suits, ballistic armor, environmental skill, and the spy drone augmentation. And more balance changes to maximize variety for many replays!

[See the full list of balance changes here in the wiki so you may be better able to adapt to the unique challenges DXRando generates.](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Balance-Changes)
