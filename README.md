# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story. The goal is to increase the replayability and strategy. You can also use it to properly configure your vanilla Deus Ex with performance fixes like DXVK, Kentie's Launcher, and config tweaks all done automatically for you.

Here's a trailer for WaltonWare mode. WaltonWare mode is focused on quick wins by completing a single bingo line, and increasing difficulty after every win. The bingo goals are all scaled to their minimum settings and you start in a random area. All bingo goals will be completable within just a few maps!

  * Giving them random names and making some of them dance
* Changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys/datacubes around the map
* Passwords and passcodes
* Exp costs for skills
    * Option for rerolling every mission, defaults to reroll every 5 missions
    * Option for disabling the Downgrade button on the new game screen, to prevent looking ahead
* What augmentations are in each canister

## There are also settings for
* Crowd Control! Let your Twitch/YouTube/Discord/other viewers troll you or help you! https://crowdcontrol.live/guides/DeusEx
    * If you want to try some of the Crowd Control features without actually streaming, you can try the "Offline Simulated" mode in the New Game screen!
* New Game+ - after beating the game play it again keeping your items, skills, and augs, but with increased difficulty and a new seed
    * Takes away 1 random augmentation, and 1 of your weapons
    * Takes away half your skill points and 5 random skill levels, so the player has to choose which ones to level up first
* New game modes! See the [(Wiki page)](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Game-Modes) for a full list!
    * WaltonWare mode - A quick option to get into the game without the time commitment of the full game! You start in a random mission and win by completing one bingo. As New Game+ keeps making it harder, see how fast you can complete them or how many you can complete!
    * Mr. Page's Mean Bingo Machine: A new mode where you play through the whole game, but must complete a set number of bingo lines before being allowed to progress to the next mission. Once you get to the next mission, you are given a new bingo board!
    * Zero Rando - great for first-time Deus Ex players to benefit from the bug fixes, QoL improvements, and balance changes we've made, without any randomization.
    * Vanilla Fixer: This one is for the purists. Use our new installer program and it will do compatibility fixes for the vanilla game (Kentie's Launcher, D3D10, DXVK, Engine.dll fix, and more), then just run DeusEx.exe as normal and the gameplay will be unchanged but with high frame rates and resolutions!
    * Randomizer Lite - randomizes some things without interfering with the immersion and mood of the game. Great for players who haven't played Deus Ex in a long time, or if you're intimidated by the full Randomizer.
    * Serious Sam mode - same as the normal game but with 10x as many enemies. The player has increased health and takes reduced damage to compensate.
    * Entrance Randomization - changes what level each teleporter takes you to, but keeps it within the same mission
    * Horde Mode - fight for your life to see how long you can survive in the Paris Cathedral
    * Various [Halloween modes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbzNkWJXZ1o) that add some survival horror mechanics!
* Challenge mode loadouts! See the [(Wiki page)](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Loadouts) for a full list!
    * Stick With the Prod Pure means the only weapon you get is the stun prod (hint: throw a crate straight up into the air to break it)
        * Stick With the Prod Plus also allows EMP grenades, gas grenades, scramble grenades, pepper gun, and tranq darts
    * Ninja JC - the only weapons allowed are throwing knives, swords, pepper spray, grenades, knife, and mini-crossbow. You also get a Ninja Augmentation which gives you speed and stealth at the same time.
    * Don't Give Me the GEP Gun - bans the GEP gun
    * Freeman Mode - only weapon allowed is the crowbar
    * Grenades Only
    * By the Book - bans lockpicks and multitools
    * Explosives Only

  * Also an external BingoDisplay program you can download from the Github [Releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases). Great for streamers who want to show their bingo progress live to viewers.

* Option to keep the game running while menus are open, making hacking or inventory management more difficult

## Balance Changes

DXRando features many small but impactful balance changes that can expand your tactical options.

The large metal crates are now destructible with 2000hp. Alcohol now fixes dead legs. Things that normally aren't useful have been buffed, such as hazmat suits, ballistic armor, environmental skill, and the spy drone augmentation. And more balance changes to maximize variety for many replays!

[See the full list of balance changes here in the wiki so you may be better able to adapt to the unique challenges DXRando generates.](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Balance-Changes)
