# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story. The goal is to increase the replayability and strategy.

## Trailers

Here's a trailer for WaltonWare mode. WaltonWare mode is focused on quick wins by completing a single bingo line, and increasing difficulty after every win. The bingo goals are all scaled to their minimum settings and you start in a random area. All bingo goals will be completable within just a few maps!

Here's a trailer for our new Mirrored Maps feature in v2.5. Play through the game with a random mix of mirrored maps, which will keep you on your toes even more than the randomizer has before!

    * Takes away 1 random augmentation, and 1 of your weapons
    * Takes away half your skill points and 5 random skill levels, so the player has to choose which ones to level up first

    * Entrance Randomization - changes what level each teleporter takes you to, but keeps it within the same mission

    * Zero Rando - great for first-time Deus Ex players to benefit from the bug fixes, QoL improvements, and balance changes we've made, without any randomization.

## Balance Changes

DXRando features many small but impactful balance changes that can expand your tactical options.

The large metal crates are now destructible with 2000hp. Alcohol now fixes dead legs. Things that normally aren't useful have been buffed, such as hazmat suits, ballistic armor, environmental skill, and the spy drone augmentation. And more balance changes to maximize variety for many replays!

[See the full list of balance changes here in the wiki so you may be better able to adapt to the unique challenges DXRando generates.](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Balance-Changes)
