# Deus Ex Randomizer

This is a mod for the original Deus Ex that takes everything and shuffles it all around to make it like a new game every time but with the same great story. The goal is to increase the replayability and strategy.

## Balance Chances

DXRando features many small but impactful balance changes that can expand your tactical options.

The large metal crates are now destructible with 2000hp. Alcohol now fixes dead legs. Things that normally aren't useful have been buffed, such as hazmat suits, ballistic armor, environmental skill, and the spy drone augmentation. And more balance changes to maximize variety for many replays!

[See the full list of balance changes here in the wiki so you may be better able to adapt to the unique challenges DXRando generates.](https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/wiki/Balance-Changes)
