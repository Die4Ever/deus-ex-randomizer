Currently in v1.1, DXRando randomizes the exp costs for skills, changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys around the map, randomizing passwords and passcodes, and changing what augmentations are in each canister. There are also options to reduce the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells, and a setting for starting the game with the running speed augmentation.
