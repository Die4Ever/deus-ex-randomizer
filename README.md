# deus-ex-randomizer

Copy the DeusEx.u file into your `Deus Ex\System\` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\System`

Recommended to use it with Kentie's Deus Exe Launcher, or Han's Launcher

Currently in v1.3.3.7, DXRando randomizes
* adding and changing characters, and giving them random names and making some of them dance
* changing the locations of items/boxes/NanoKeys around the map
* passwords and passcodes
* the locations of datacubes
* exp costs for skills
* what augmentations are in each canister

There are also settings for
* making all doors that normally require a key also lockpickable/destructible
* making all keypads hackable.
* reducing the drop rate for ammo, multitools, lockpicks, medkits, and bioelectric cells
* starting the game with the running speed augmentation
* autosave
* removing invisible walls
