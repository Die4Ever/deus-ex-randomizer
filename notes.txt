Needed this to run UnrealEd http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility/1/win98/EN-US/Msvbvm50.exe

ambrosia in battery park, maybe I should never move ambrosia?
key to bathroom in mole tunnel 03_NYC_MolePeople seems to be the only way to progress? maybe modify the properties on the door to make it breakable and lockpickable?
there are no items to swap with past the door, but it maybe be possible for the key to be attempted to be placed in a bad area? maybe I should copy the key into the NSF leader's inventory so you can always kill him for it? or can I modify his dialog so that he just gives you the key?
the key name is NanoKey0, KeyID is MoleRestroomKey, the door name is DeusExMover65

I can use this for string hashing http://www.unrealtexture.com/Unreal/Downloads/3DEditing/UnrealEd/Tutorials/unrealwiki-offline/crc32.html

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?
