Needed this to run UnrealEd http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility/1/win98/EN-US/Msvbvm50.exe

X start with running speed aug, at max level? max level is too OP
X don't give 2 of the same aug in a canister
x rename test function
x fix pistol starting level?
organize the fixes for individual levels
X fix skill cost generation
X log statements
X don't swap actor with itself
maybe set the seed inside the foreach AllActors loop to keep it more stable?
need a function for GiveRandomItem()
need a function for CloneNanoKey() (based on Engine.Pickup.SpawnCopy? no, that's for respawning items)
need to figure out how to modify conversations, datacubes, emails...
x should meme up the endings too

x DeusExPlayer has function DeusExNote AddNote( optional String strNote, optional Bool bUserNote, optional bool bShowInLog )
x     could use a timer in the MissionScript to check for new notes?

options for keys randomization = none, dumb, smart, copy (smart would be based on distance compared to the door, should it factor X and Z distance more than Y distance so it favors it being on the same floor?)
x all doors destructible, pickable, either, both
ambient lighting adjustment, AI hearing and vision adjustment, enemy health
x fix aug randomization
rando dragoon's tooth sword? nerf it?
x copy Physics property when swapping?
    -actor class also has these:
        var const Actor           Base;          // Moving brush actor we're standing on.
        native(298) final function SetBase( actor NewBase );
        var const PointRegion     Region;        // Region this actor is in.
        var(Collision) const bool bCollideActors;   // Collides with other actors.
        var(Collision) bool       bCollideWorld;    // Collides with the world.
        var(Collision) bool       bBlockActors;	    // Blocks other nonplayer actors.
        var(Collision) bool       bBlockPlayers;    // Blocks other player actors.
exploded corpses drop keys?
bIsItemGoal?
should NanoKeys have buoyancy?
what does minDamageThreshold do for doors? important doors shouldn't be breakable by the dragoon's tooth
-cameras have a minDamageThreshold of 50

ambrosia in battery park, maybe I should never move ambrosia?
key to bathroom in mole tunnel 03_NYC_MolePeople seems to be the only way to progress? maybe modify the properties on the door to make it breakable and lockpickable?
there are no items to swap with past the door, but it maybe be possible for the key to be attempted to be placed in a bad area? maybe I should copy the key into the NSF leader's inventory so you can always kill him for it? or can I modify his dialog so that he just gives you the key?
the key name is NanoKey0, KeyID is MoleRestroomKey, the door name is DeusExMover65

airfield barracks 03_NYC_Airfield KeyID eastgate, DeusExMover1
(walkthrough says this, so maybe I just got unlucky blowing up too many dudes, need to drop keys out of exploded bodies
"There is a control box here with a button that will open the door. Use an East Gate Nano key to open it (it's INF/INF), which you can get in the shack by the bay (where you came in if you swam) or from one of the many guards about. Some of them have security keys, and other have gate keys.")

06_HongKong_Helibase required key KeyID control_door01, DeusExMover21

Chateau DuClare sounds like it has some required keys?

x I can use this for string hashing http://www.unrealtexture.com/Unreal/Downloads/3DEditing/UnrealEd/Tutorials/unrealwiki-offline/crc32.html

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?

unrealscript gui:
seed, skill cost %s, starting points, ammo %, lockpick %, multitool %, money %, bioelectric cells %, health%, base movement speed %? falling damage %? passcodes and passwords
can I improve ladders just make them super sticky and press jump to get off?
starting level?

randomize exp requirements, randomize item spawns (weapons, ammo, healing bots, crates, explosive barrels, enemies)

charisma setting that disables random dialog options with low charisma?

randomize passwords
