for v1.5 ========================
teleporters have a bEnabled flag
write tests for repeated use of teleporters, and for denying one-way maps
fix dupes like:
DXREntranceRando: Found 06_HONGKONG_MJ12LAB.MapExit0 with destination 06_HongKong_Storage#basement, changed to 06_HONGKONG_HELIBASE#Helibase
DXREntranceRando: Found 06_HONGKONG_MJ12LAB.MapExit0 with destination 06_HongKong_Storage#basement, changed to 06_HONGKONG_WANCHAI_CANAL#Street

you cannot climb out of 03_NYC_AirfieldHeliBase#FromOcean


the code for attaching grenades to walls is interesting
from DeusExWeapon.uc `simulated function bool NearWallCheck()`
```
    // trace out one foot in front of the pawn
    StartTrace = Owner.Location;
    EndTrace = StartTrace + Vector(Pawn(Owner).ViewRotation) * 32;

    StartTrace.Z += Pawn(Owner).BaseEyeHeight;
    EndTrace.Z += Pawn(Owner).BaseEyeHeight;

    HitActor = Trace(HitLocation, HitNormal, EndTrace, StartTrace);
    if ((HitActor == Level) || ((HitActor != None) && HitActor.IsA('Mover')))
    {
        placeLocation = HitLocation;
        placeNormal = HitNormal;
        placeMover = Mover(HitActor);
        return True;
    }
```
and then from `function PlaceGrenade()`
```
    gren = ThrownProjectile(spawn(ProjectileClass, Owner,, placeLocation, Rotator(placeNormal)));
    if (gren != None)
    {
        gren.SetPhysics(PHYS_None);
        gren.bBounce = False;
        gren.bProximityTriggered = True;
        gren.bStuck = True;
        if (placeMover != None)
            gren.SetBase(placeMover);

        // up the damage based on the skill
        // returned value from GetWeaponSkill is negative, so negate it to make it positive
        // dmgX value ranges from 1.0 to 2.4 (max demo skill and max target aug)
        dmgX = -2.0 * GetWeaponSkill() + 1.0;
        gren.Damage *= dmgX;
```

for v1.4========================

nah said:
"also ULevel::SpawnPlayActor also exposed a bNoColissionFail parameter, which is really handy/needed when you wanna replace any actors. some otherwise fail to spawn"

I could make an AugSkill class to turn any skill into an augmentation (might need dummy child classes just due to the way the augmentation manager works)
    -look AugAqualung as an example, could easily adjust the player's skill level in state Active Begin and function Deactivate()
    -energy cost could be based on the cost of the original skill
    -use the augmentation level to give skill levels
    -might be OP if one player gets lucky and finds the hacking augmentation in a race

randomly remove/move medbots and repair bots?

add more tests? I should maybe make tests only run once per launch, maybe like on localURL == "DX" maybe the training area or liberty island cause some tests will need a world?
    -tests for ClassIsA, skill randomization, augs...

I can make more stuff data-driven
    -config to enable/disable modules? modules in a separate package?
    -DXRReduceItems could receive arguments/config for which classes of items to reduce and what %
    -each module should be in charge of their own flags and flagnames?
    -config value for enabling tests
    -I can display a crc hash of the configs and flags as a clientmessage, like how the seed is shown

split up the Swap function, support multiple classes for SwapAll? or just support NavigationPoints?

NavigationPoint (children: PathNode, PatrolPoint, AmbushPoint, InventorySpot) for extra positions where items can be placed?

    - https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/CharactersTechnicalGuide.html#Pawns%20and%20Possession
    - Pawn class - native(518) final function Actor FindPathTo(vector aPoint, optional bool bSinglePath, 
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    - FindPathTo [aPoint] [MaxPathLength] [bReturnPartial] - This calculates a path to the navigation node closest to the given destination and returns the next node along that path.

    - Pawn class - native(517) final function Actor FindPathToward(actor anActor, optional bool bSinglePath, 
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    - FindPathToward [anActor] [bWeightDetours] [MaxPathLength] [bReturnPartial] - This calculates a path to the navigation node closest to the given actor and returns the next node along that path.
    PointReachable [aPoint] - This returns whether the specified location is directly reachable given the Pawn’s movement capabilities. This function can be expensive and should be avoided in favor of ActorReachable() if possible.
    ActorReachable [anActor] - This returns whether the specified Actor is directly reachable given the Pawn’s movement capabilities. Though potentially more optimized than PointReachable(), this function also can be expensive and should be used sparingly.
    I can use FindPath to determine if I can do a key swap? find path from key to path in question, walk through the NavigationPoints and see if the door is in between any of them?
    -what does this do? native(525) final function NavigationPoint FindRandomDest(optional bool bClearPaths);
        -FindRandomDest - This returns a random node on the navigation network. This can be good for creating a state where the character roams the world.
    -I could find all the NavigationPoints within a small radius of the door, and whichever ones are farther from the key than the door is are bad points that should indicate a failed path finding
        -should this be done in a preparation loop, or while doing the pathfinding?

native(724) final function bool GetBoundingBox(out vector MinVect, out vector MaxVect,
                                               optional bool bExact,
                                               optional vector testLocation,
                                               optional rotator testRotation);

//
// Trace a line and see what it collides with first.
// Takes this actor's collision properties into account.
// Returns first hit actor, Level if hit level, or None if hit nothing.
//
native(277) final function Actor Trace
(
	out vector      HitLocation,
	out vector      HitNormal,
	vector          TraceEnd,
	optional vector TraceStart,
	optional bool   bTraceActors,
	optional vector Extent
);

TraceActors loop doesn't seem useful

native(533) final function bool CanSee(actor Other);

Keypoint, the base class of invisible actors which mark things.
    -LocationID - marks and names an area in a zone

// WarpZoneInfo. For making disjoint spaces appear as if they were connected;
// supports both in-level warp zones and cross-level warp zones.

track times per mission and overall (RTA or IGT?)

for v1.3.3.7====================

to generate the list of all actors, I used windows command prompt dir /B to list the files
I used this website to do quick regexes https://www.regexpal.com/?fam=97259
paste in the list output by dir /B then use this match regex
^(.*)\.uc$
then use this substitution regex
is_valid("$1", class'$1');

run the outputted code in Deus Ex with this function

function bool is_valid(string s, class<Object> o)
{
    local class<Actor> a;
    a = class<Actor>(o);
    if ( a == None ) return false;
    if ( a.default.bHidden ) return false;
    if ( a.default.Mesh == None ) return false;
    if ( a.default.DrawType != DT_Mesh ) return false;
    if ( a.default.Style != STY_Normal ) return false;

    log( "if ( r == i++ ) return class'" $ s $ "';" );
    i++;
    return true;
}

then paste the log output back into the website using this match regex
^(ScriptLog: )(.*)$
and this substitution regex
$2

the output from that will fill the meat of the GetRandomActorClass function


for v1.2========================

x autosave
- MenuScreenSaveGame
- DeusExSaveInfo
can I randomize computer skill requirements? I can randomize the EAccessLevel, but it doesn't do anything? gonna need my class injector to make this clean

=============================

need a function for GiveRandomItem()
need a function for CloneNanoKey() (based on Engine.Pickup.SpawnCopy? no, that's for respawning items)
need to figure out how to modify conversations, datacubes, emails...

AI hearing and vision adjustment, enemy health
rando dragoon's tooth sword? nerf it?
actor class also has these:
    var const Actor           Base;          // Moving brush actor we're standing on.
    native(298) final function SetBase( actor NewBase );
    var const PointRegion     Region;        // Region this actor is in.
    var(Collision) const bool bCollideActors;   // Collides with other actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bCollideWorld;    // Collides with the world.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockActors;	    // Blocks other nonplayer actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockPlayers;    // Blocks other player actors.

exploded corpses drop keys?
bIsItemGoal?
should NanoKeys have buoyancy?

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?
