### Installation Instructions for Revision

Install Revision from Steam or https://www.moddb.com/mods/deus-ex-revision/downloads/deus-ex-revision

Download `RevRandomizer.u`  from the releases page here https://github.com/Die4Ever/deus-ex-randomizer/releases

Copy `RevRandomizer.u` into the game's `Revision\System` folder, which is probably `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\Revision\System`

Edit the `Revision.ini` file which is probably in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deus Ex\Revision\System`

In the `[Engine.Engine]` section, change `DefaultGame` from `DefaultGame=Revision.RevGameInfo` to `DefaultGame=RevRandomizer.DXRandoGameInfo` and change `Root` from `Root=Revision.RevRootWindow` to `Root=RevRandomizer.DXRandoRootWindow`

Revision Randomizer is in early alpha testing and does not support all of the features that the vanilla randomizer has.

Needed this to run UnrealEd http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/utility/1/win98/EN-US/Msvbvm50.exe

16 units is 1 foot, from DeusExPlayer.uc:
// check a 100 foot radius around me for combat
if ((npc != None) && (VSize(npc.Location - p.Location) < (1600 + npc.CollisionRadius)))

what does this ResetKeyboard() function do?

in order to decompile VMD I had to copy VMDSim.ini to DeusEx.ini
and in order to compile again I had to copy the .u files out of VMDSim\System\ and into System\

in HX, use the switchcooplevel command to load a level

in order to decompile HX with UnrealEd, or compile HXRandomizer, you'll need to add the EditPackages lines to the DeusEx.ini file in the HX System folder

v1.6.1 Alpha:
	notify player when skill costs are rerolled
	does HX need more ammo?
	"Race" difficulty, same as hard mode but disable rando goals?
	crowd control auto save when giving items?
	NG+ should be able to downlevel default augs, just not below the default level?
		make StartedWithAug return an int of the starting level instead of just a bool
	DXRLoadouts ensure tnt crates don't spawn too far from the ground
	bug in sub base backtracking chopper
	do I need to make choppers appear when backtracking? like appearing at the mapexit on the roof of the sub base?
	tweak rotations for teleporters? just automatically face away from nearby teleporters/mapexits?
	manually add actors to the safety checks for keys and datacubes, as an easier version of the safe_rules
	maybe clean up the credits a bit more, especially the DXRFlags section

v1.6.1:
	show maxCopies for item descriptions
	use better logic for The Merchant's location, like cameras?
	use key safe location logic for hazmats vs damage zones (this might only be a big deal for paris?)
	fix the dumb button to backtrack in paris metro, stacked boxes is better
	if I get rid of the ZoneVelocity on WaterZone5 in 06_hongkong_storage, I can add a dynamicteleporter to make that pipe a 2-way connection
		might also need to do WaterZone1, but that would make it difficult to hold your breath through there, I could make a dynamicteleporter bring you past that
	DXREntranceRando: WARNING: GenerateConnections(12) succeeded but took 24 attempts! seed: 158016, genconsfails: 7, validatefails: 17
	lore friendly enemy spawns? triads would be good extra enemies in hong kong at least

for v1.6.1+ programatically modify conversations? ===================
fix tagging for HX for autoupdate Downloads, will need to inspect own class name to figure out the tag in GetClassFromString
	Warning: Failed to load 'HXRandomizer': Can't find file for package 'HXRandomizer'
	Warning: Failed to load 'Class HXRandomizer.DXRSwapItems': Can't find file for package 'HXRandomizer'
	DXRFlags_20210615: ERROR: GetClassFromString: failed to load class HXRandomizer.DXRSwapItems
all enemies have LAWs mode?
automated tests in HX?
any way I could get DXRNames to work with replication?
scale difficulty with extra players like diablo, slightly increase enemy randomization and combat difficulty
HX: DXRMissions, DXRFixup? DXRHordeMode? credits, new game plus? DXRStats? crowd control, gonna need to add simulated to like every function
DXRWeapons projectile damage
crowd control spawn medbot, friendly milbot
crowd control incremental speed effects
crowd control, ensure you don't go past the max ammo
can I partially re-enable Paul's conversation in liberty island and remove the part where he gives you a weapon?
	will need to mark it as played when entering unatco though, pretty sure it can break stuff
GUI for NG+? can open a window similar to the advanced settings page
create new "stories", start with a hub area (either hell's kitchen or hong kong, but which hell's kitchen?)
	class DXRStories extends DXREntranceRando;
	move stuff from DXRBacktracking into functions to "open up" areas, so they can be called from DXRStories
	connect a bunch of random maps to it (from any mission)
	how to determine if a map should be neutral or hostile?
	remove all vanilla npcs and dialog and add new ones
	after beating a hub area, it can take you to the "next" area just by running a different seed, maybe do something to ensure it's based on a different hub area
	I need to reuse the data in DXREntranceRando, maybe by subclassing it
for better log message window, look at DeusExRootWindow ClientMessage function, and HUDLogDisplay AddLog and SetLogTimeout functions
HUD to show current energy use per second, similar to the damage resistance HUD
	could allow randomization of aug energy usage
dynamically generate patrol routes? will probably need a new state for scriptedpawns to replace patrolling
randomize item pool by replacing 50% of items?
with flags binding, maybe I could convert some of them to floats or ints x100
flashbang grenades?
	for flashbang grenades, stun duration is hardcoded to sleep for 15 seconds in ScriptedPawn state Stunned Begin, maybe have to call them stun grenades

CleanerBot Tick function could also cleanup Effects, TrashPaper, Fragment...

UWindowHTMLTextArea
ninja mode (maybe rename low tech skill to ninjitsu, and always run silent?
fix "softlock" in 03_batterypark, maybe by adding an atm and datacube, or copying over the threatened bum from 02_street, putting a note on curly's body, hiding money and/or datacubes on the map...
-filben wants 1000 credits!
-using a vending machine takes 2 credits, so the vending machines in unatco mean -40 credits
-manderley gives you a minimum of 500 credits, so you have a minimum of 460 credits and I need to give a minimum of 540 credits in 03_batterypark
-hacking an atm gives less money, so I need to have more than 540 in the atm?
	-hacked atm balance modifier - balanceModifier = winTerm.GetSkillLevel() * 0.5;
	-which means level 1 gets half money
-I can do 800 in the atm with a datacube for it, and 150 on the ground somewhere
-will also need something if you kill curly, dropping a datacube would be cool
-should I also make the phone booth breakable?
-I can also try copying the AlleyBum and AlleyThug (maybe 3 thugs this time?) from 02 nyc streets, but I'm pretty sure I'll manually need to modify his ConListItems (sets flags AlleyBumRescued and PlayerKnowsUnderworldPassword)
	// check to see if player rescued bum
	if (!flags.GetBool('MS_ThugsDead'))

	}



maybe add a list of unimportantMaps for DXREntranceRando? maybe chateau, freeclinic, nyc sewers, smuggler, gas station, graveyard?
    in order to keep play time more consistent never do all or none of them?
have different "Level Sets"

should I add an option for "normal skill rando every 5 missions"?

combine medkits/biocells/lockpicks/multitools into just items drop rate?

for v1.5 ========================

another issue with DXREntranceRando:
    if I make a connection from paris metro to chateau, DXREntranceRando will ensure I can get to the metro to get to the chateau, but it won't realize that I also need to get to the club first
    similarly, you go from 12_vandenberg_cmd to gas station, but you need to get to 12_vandenberg_computer first before the chopper will appear
    might need a `string other_required_map` for each transfer?
lots of doors that need buttons on the other side in mission 14, and maybe 12_vandenberg_tunnels could use that too instead of making it open on player bump
write tests for repeated use of teleporters, and for denying one-way maps
need to test that a player can move back and forth through all maps, not just capable of visiting them all once, or getting stuck/softlocked in a dead-end

for v1.4========================

nah said:
"also ULevel::SpawnPlayActor also exposed a bNoColissionFail parameter, which is really handy/needed when you wanna replace any actors. some otherwise fail to spawn"

I could make an AugSkill class to turn any skill into an augmentation (might need dummy child classes just due to the way the augmentation manager works)
    -look AugAqualung as an example, could easily adjust the player's skill level in state Active Begin and function Deactivate()
    -energy cost could be based on the cost of the original skill
    -use the augmentation level to give skill levels
    -might be OP if one player gets lucky and finds the hacking augmentation in a race

NavigationPoint (children: PathNode, PatrolPoint, AmbushPoint, InventorySpot) for extra positions where items can be placed?

    - https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Three/CharactersTechnicalGuide.html#Pawns%20and%20Possession
    - Pawn class - native(518) final function Actor FindPathTo(vector aPoint, optional bool bSinglePath,
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    - FindPathTo [aPoint] [MaxPathLength] [bReturnPartial] - This calculates a path to the navigation node closest to the given destination and returns the next node along that path.

    - Pawn class - native(517) final function Actor FindPathToward(actor anActor, optional bool bSinglePath,
												optional bool bClearPaths);
    - FindPathToward [anActor] [bWeightDetours] [MaxPathLength] [bReturnPartial] - This calculates a path to the navigation node closest to the given actor and returns the next node along that path.
    PointReachable [aPoint] - This returns whether the specified location is directly reachable given the Pawn’s movement capabilities. This function can be expensive and should be avoided in favor of ActorReachable() if possible.
    ActorReachable [anActor] - This returns whether the specified Actor is directly reachable given the Pawn’s movement capabilities. Though potentially more optimized than PointReachable(), this function also can be expensive and should be used sparingly.
    I can use FindPath to determine if I can do a key swap? find path from key to path in question, walk through the NavigationPoints and see if the door is in between any of them?
    -what does this do? native(525) final function NavigationPoint FindRandomDest(optional bool bClearPaths);
        -FindRandomDest - This returns a random node on the navigation network. This can be good for creating a state where the character roams the world.
    -I could find all the NavigationPoints within a small radius of the door, and whichever ones are farther from the key than the door is are bad points that should indicate a failed path finding
        -should this be done in a preparation loop, or while doing the pathfinding?

native(724) final function bool GetBoundingBox(out vector MinVect, out vector MaxVect,
                                               optional bool bExact,
                                               optional vector testLocation,
                                               optional rotator testRotation);

//
// Trace a line and see what it collides with first.
// Takes this actor's collision properties into account.
// Returns first hit actor, Level if hit level, or None if hit nothing.
//
https://docs.unrealengine.com/udk/Two/ActorFunctions.html#Trace
native(277) final function Actor Trace
(
	out vector      HitLocation,
	out vector      HitNormal,
	vector          TraceEnd,
	optional vector TraceStart,
	optional bool   bTraceActors,
	optional vector Extent
);

TraceActors loop doesn't seem useful

native(533) final function bool CanSee(actor Other);

Keypoint, the base class of invisible actors which mark things.
    -LocationID - marks and names an area in a zone

// WarpZoneInfo. For making disjoint spaces appear as if they were connected;
// supports both in-level warp zones and cross-level warp zones.

track times per mission and overall (RTA or IGT?)

for v1.3.3.7====================

to generate the list of all actors, I used windows command prompt dir /B to list the files
I used this website to do quick regexes https://www.regexpal.com/?fam=97259
paste in the list output by dir /B then use this match regex
^(.*)\.uc$
then use this substitution regex
is_valid("$1", class'$1');

run the outputted code in Deus Ex with this function

function bool is_valid(string s, class<Object> o)
{
    local class<Actor> a;
    a = class<Actor>(o);
    if ( a == None ) return false;
    if ( a.default.bHidden ) return false;
    if ( a.default.Mesh == None ) return false;
    if ( a.default.DrawType != DT_Mesh ) return false;
    if ( a.default.Style != STY_Normal ) return false;

    log( "if ( r == i++ ) return class'" $ s $ "';" );
    i++;
    return true;
}

then paste the log output back into the website using this match regex
^(ScriptLog: )(.*)$
and this substitution regex
$2

the output from that will fill the meat of the GetRandomActorClass function


for v1.2========================

x autosave
- MenuScreenSaveGame
- DeusExSaveInfo
can I randomize computer skill requirements? I can randomize the EAccessLevel, but it doesn't do anything? gonna need my class injector to make this clean
I could also randomize how long it takes to hack, if it's long enough then you'll need higher computer skill to be able to do it

=============================

need a function for GiveRandomItem()
need a function for CloneNanoKey()
need to figure out how to modify conversations

AI hearing and vision adjustment, enemy health
actor class also has these:
    var const Actor           Base;          // Moving brush actor we're standing on.
    native(298) final function SetBase( actor NewBase );
    var const PointRegion     Region;        // Region this actor is in.
    var(Collision) const bool bCollideActors;   // Collides with other actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bCollideWorld;    // Collides with the world.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockActors;	    // Blocks other nonplayer actors.
    var(Collision) bool       bBlockPlayers;    // Blocks other player actors.

bIsItemGoal?
should NanoKeys have buoyancy?

maybe I can rewrite this as a mutator?
