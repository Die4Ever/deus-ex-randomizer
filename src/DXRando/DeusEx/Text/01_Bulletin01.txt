<P><B>Terrorism -- Crime or Conscience?</B>
<P>
<P>The question must be asked: is the global rise of terrorism a haphazard response to a decimated economy or is there a pattern?  Does UNATCO face coordinated ideological opposition?
<P>
<P>Some groups -- Silhouette in France, for instance -- have declared a "Meme War," or "war of meanings" in their terminology.  They spread email and pamphlets that lampoon the U.N.'s proposal for a one-world democracy, a tedious exercise in rudimentary propaganda.  With sophistries and doublespeak, they portray "freedom" as "obedience," "democracy" as "tyranny," and UNATCO as the perpetrator of terrorism -- an idea as shocking as it is reprehensible.
<P>
<P>Other organizations, such as the self-proclaimed revolutionary National Seccessionist Forces (NSF) in the U.S., claim allegiance to the Meme War, but are in fact no better than common criminals.  They desire territory and wealth at the expense of society at large.  Their "civil war" is merely a smokescreen for criminal activity.
<P>
<P>Any population can be quickly turned against such "revolutionaries" simply by educating them about the U.N.'s policies and goals.
