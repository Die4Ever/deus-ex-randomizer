<P>
<P>I've done my best to convey this to my people, but to be frank, I think we'll need to assume that collateral damage is inevitable and mobilize our own propaganda efforts _now_ in order to blunt or deflect any negative psychological repercussions.  Most of those in the field haven't had any formal military training, and I'm already receiving reports that the action in Hell's Kitchen has resulted in a number of "friendly fire" casualties and hostage situations.  UNATCO's counter-attack has been more agressive than expected, and some of our troops are going to make bad decisions under pressure.

<P>>We need to impress upon those under our command that
<P>>collateral damage in the form of civilian casualties
<P>>must be avoided at all possible costs -- the value of
<P>>dead or wounded civilians to UNATCO propaganda efforts
<P>>is incalculable and will significantly set back our
<P>>cause.
