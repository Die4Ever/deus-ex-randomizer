<P><B>Know Your Enemy -- Templars</B>
<P>
<P>There is some debate as to whether the Templars should be considered a "terrorist" organization because they do not employ the typical tools of terrorism.  But make no mistake, the Templars are just as dangerous as any other group that might use guns and bombs to intimidate the free citizens of a country -- only the Templars wield blackmail and extortion as their weapons.  Supposedly the direct descendent of a so-called "secret society" with its roots in the medieval Crusades, the present-day Templars are mainly concerned with increasing their own bank accounts in elaborately illegal financial manipulations that have left entire markets collapsed in their wake. 
<P>
<P>The Templars are currently classified as inactive after being successfully diminished by a combined UNATCO/Interpol raid on their Paris headquarters in 2051; however, several key Templar figures are still at large and may attempt to reform the organization under a new designation.
