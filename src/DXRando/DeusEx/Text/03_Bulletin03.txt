<P><B>Stopping Terror -- A New Perspective on Freedom</B>
<P>
<P>When one maniac can wipe out a city of twenty million with a microbe developed in his basement, a new approach to law enforcement becomes necessary.  Every citizen of the world must be placed under surveillance.  That means sky-cams at every intersection, computer-mediated analysis of every phone call, e-mail, and snail-mail, and a purely electronic economy in which every transaction is recorded and data-mined for suspicious activity.
<P>
<P>We are close to achieving this goal.  Some would say that human liberty has been compromised, but the reality is just the opposite.  As surveillance expands, people become free from danger, free to walk alone at night, free to work in a safe place, and free to buy any legal product or service without the threat of fraud.  One day every man and woman will quietly earn credits, purchase items for quiet homes on quiet streets, have cook-outs with neighbors and strangers alike, and sleep with doors and windows wide open.  If that isn't the tranquil dream of every free civilization throughout history, what is?
