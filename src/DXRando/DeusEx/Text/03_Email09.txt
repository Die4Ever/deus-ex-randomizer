<P>The Oracle says:
<P>
<P>We find your question interesting.  We have several references to entity token "MJ12" but all are ambiguous.  Will be necessary to expend cycles to clarify relationships for codification of representative patterns before further recognition can be accomplished.  This will be time consuming, but past working relationships have shown a 83.23% favorable return.  Work with file "SH-187" was very instructive.
<P>
<P>We will contact you again when information has been collated.
