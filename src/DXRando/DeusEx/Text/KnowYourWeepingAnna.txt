<P><B>Know Your Stalker -- Weeping Anna</B>
<P>
<P>They are quantum locked: they don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they are seen they freeze into rock. They literally turn to stone, and you can't kill a stone.
<P>
<P>They are fast. Faster than you could believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and don't blink!
