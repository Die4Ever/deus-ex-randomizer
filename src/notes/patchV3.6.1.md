- Added support for autorun in Revision.  At the moment, it is not configurable through the in-game keybinds and must be manually configured.
  - In the RevisionUser.ini file, go to the \[Extension.InputExt\] section and find the key you want to bind to enable autorun.  Change it so that it maps to ToggleAutorun, eg. to make C enable autorun: `C=ToggleAutorun`
- Doors into the M03 hangar (on both sides) are no longer potentially destroyable
- Keypad on the helipad-side door to the M03 hangar can no longer be hacked
