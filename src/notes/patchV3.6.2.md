- Added new Stalker type: Weeping Anna.
  - She can only move, attack, or be damaged while you are looking away.
  - She's fast, faster than you can believe.
  - Learn to run backwards and always keep her in sight.
  - You can try to attach a LAM to the floor and look away before it explodes. Or shoot a projectile and turn away quickly. Even tranquilizer darts will work.
- Added new Stalker type: Bobby.
  - Little guy with a big knife.
  - Hangs out in packs but he doesn't have much health.
  - Once you see him he will stay facing you. When you turn your back he will pull out his knife and attack with all his buddies.
  - There will also be many unpossessed dolls on each map, even maps with no possessed Bobbys. They still face you because that's a function of the Page Industries toy: "We even turn our heads and blink our eyes."
  - In default Halloween mode settings, if you see a Mr. H or Weeping Anna this means there cannot also be any possessed Bobbys in the same map.
  - When he's low on health he will run away and try to find an unpossessed doll to transfer his soul into. The area will briefly go dark when he does this.
  - You can destroy the unpossessed Bobbys in order to prevent his soul transfer.
