- Adjusted the rotation of several goal randomization locations
  - The Terrorist Commander on Liberty Island now looks out over the North Dock
  - The location near the water valves in Brooklyn Bridge Station now looks towards the steam vents instead of looking at the wall
  - The location on the East side of the Rooks' territory in Brooklyn Bridge Station now looks into the hall area, instead of towards the fence
  - The location in Manderley's bathroom in mission 5 now looks towards the door instead of the wall
  - The location in the UNATCO HQ West office in mission 5 now looks vaguely towards the centre of the room, instead of being perfectly parallel with the wall
- Adjusted the location of the character in the North-West corner of Brooklyn Bridge station slightly so that they won't end up inside a box when containers get shuffled sometimes
