- Tweaked weapon placements for different FoVs and ultra-widescreen
- Alarm lights now count for the "Light Vandalism" bingo goal, if they are breakable

  - If you have already encountered the Merchant in a map in an in-progress game when you upgrade, he may be a bit confused about what he has available to sell to you.

  - Beyond the level transitions between the Wan Chai Market and the Lucky Money
  - Beyond the door to the Vandenberg Computer area from Cmd
