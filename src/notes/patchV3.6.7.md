- Goals that require the use of drugs or alcohol will no longer be available when those items are banned (eg. in the Straight Edge loadout)
- Tweaked weapon placements for different FoVs and ultra-widescreen
- Alarm lights now count for the "Light Vandalism" bingo goal, if they are breakable
- Fixed mirrored rotation of Limited/Fixed Saves ATM that was added to the gas station, and moved it forwards slightly to get away from some bad collision detection
- Fixed possible crashes with flag names generated for Merchant conversations that exceeded the maximum length.
  - If you have already encountered the Merchant in a map in an in-progress game when you upgrade, he may be a bit confused about what he has available to sell to you.
- Block certain out-of-bounds locations from being selected for random placement of things (like medbots/repairbots, merchants, turrets, datacubes, etc...)
  - Outside of the walls of the UNATCO compound in missions 3, 4, and 5
  - Beyond the level transitions between the Wan Chai Market and the Lucky Money
  - Beyond the door to the Vandenberg Computer area from Cmd
- The Bingo Viewer now has an option to always keep the window on top (Under the Display menu)
- Looking at Weeping Anna will no longer interrupt her death animation
- For GMDX we now set Hardcore mode when playing on combatDifficulty 4 or higher
- Fixed randomizing some of GMDX's invisible objects
- Fixed bug with conversations referencing player's kill counts in M01 and M02
- Added a timed race to Vandenberg Tunnels (in both the forward and backward directions):  See how fast you can go!
- UNATCO Troopers that appear in Mission 3, after meeting Lebedev, will no longer hate seeing carcasses (which typically makes them hate the player)
- The bingo goal for returning to UNATCO HQ in the boat after Mission 2 no longer appears unless the bingo board spans more than 1 mission.
- Possible fix for some timed races (eg. Catacombs or Reverse Catacombs) where the Mastodon messages were reporting the player losing over 9000% health.
- Fixed installer failing with Documents path issues
