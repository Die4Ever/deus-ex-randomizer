- Goals that require the use of drugs or alcohol will no longer be available when those items are banned (eg. in the Straight Edge loadout)
- Tweaked weapon placements for different FoVs and ultra-widescreen
- Alarm lights now count for the "Light Vandalism" bingo goal, if they are breakable
- Fixed mirrored rotation of Limited/Fixed Saves ATM that was added to the gas station, and moved it forwards slightly to get away from some bad collision detection
- Fixed possible crashes with flag names generated for Merchant conversations that exceeded the maximum length.
  - If you have already encountered the Merchant in a map in an in-progress game when you upgrade, he may be a bit confused about what he has available to sell to you.
